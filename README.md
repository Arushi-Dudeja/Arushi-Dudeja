⚡ Fun fact: For some mysterious reason, I truly believe in the 10,000 hour rule (aka the assertion made by Malcolm Gladwell in the book "Outliers" that the key to achieving true expertise in any skill is simply a matter of practicing, albeit in the correct way, for at least 10 000 hours). Currently I stand at 187 out of 10,000 hours of Data Science!
